# Physics Notes

## Realisms
- Find a way to show physics is real
- Angle impulse calculations?

## Optimizations
- Implement a quadtree
- Due to mostly static nature of the program (few dynamic objects and calculations with many statics)
    - Have quadtree store components of static for collisions (e.g. line collision, circle collision)
- No need for dynamic objects optimizations

## CCD
CCD by halving velocity and multiple substeps (todo: calculations on ratio & further optimizations)

## Level Editor
Good luck on this one!
